# ML-simple-algo
The idea behind this repository is to provide simple supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms.
The classes are created independently of each other (except k-means and form forte), in the purpose of helping students to learn how to code them from scratch (not really from scratch but by using only numpy).
